## Documentation
Documentation can be found on https://kariappa.github.io/CS1XA3/ (Not all of the parsers documentation is appearing)


## Citation:
1. For the parser I followed some of Akram Elwazana's code https://github.com/elwazana/CS1XA3
2. For Antiderivative I used some of Noa Barskys code  https://github.com/barskyn/CS1XA3
3. I got a test case Idea from Jessica De Leeuw's code https://github.com/deleeuwj1
